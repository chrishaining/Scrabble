# Scrabble

![tiles](tiles.png)


This is a small program I worked on to develop my skills in Python dictionaries.

The aim of the program is to randomly assign letters of the alphabet to each player in the game. The player then makes a word using their letters. A word is a valid if:
    1. it is a possible combination from the player's letters; and
    2. and it is in an accepted word list).
If the word is valid, the program calculates how many points the word has. The player with the most points wins.


## What you need to run the file
* Python version 3
* random and PyDictionary packages


## My main learning points from this project
* using the PyDictionary package
* using the random package
* getting user input
